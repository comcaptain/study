## Amazon Machine Image

When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting you configure is which operating system you want by selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

In the traditional infrastructure world, spinning up a server consists of installing an operating system from installation disks, drives, or wizards over the network. In the AWS Cloud, the operating system installation is not your responsibility. Instead, it's built into the AMI that you choose.

An AMI includes the operating system, storage mapping, architecture type, launch permissions, and any additional preinstalled software applications.

## EC2 instance lifecycle

An EC2 instance transitions between different states from the moment you create it until its termination.

1. When you launch an instance, it enters the **pending** state. When an instance is pending, billing has not started. At this stage, the instance is preparing to enter the running state. Pending is where AWS performs all actions needed to set up an instance, such as copying the AMI content to the root device and allocating the necessary networking components.

2. When your instance is **running**, it's ready to use. This is also the stage where billing begins. As soon as an instance is running, you can take other actions on the instance, such as reboot, terminate, stop, and stop-hibernate.
3. When you reboot an instance, itâ€™s different than performing a stop action and then a start action. **Rebooting** an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system. The instance keeps its public DNS name (IPv4) and private and public IPv4 addresses. An IPv6 address (if applicable) remains on the same host computer and maintains its public and private IP address, in addition to any data on its instance store volumes.
4. When you stop your instance, it enters the **stopping** and then **stopped** state. This is similar to when you shut down your laptop. You can stop and start an instance if it has an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume as its root device. When you stop and start an instance, your instance can be placed on a new underlying physical server. Your instance retains its private IPv4 addresses and if your instance has an IPv6 address, it retains its IPv6 address. When you put the instance into stop-hibernate, the instance enters the stopped state, but saves the last information or content into memory, so that the start process is faster.
5. When you **terminate** an instance, the instance stores are erased, and you lose both the public IP address and private IP address of the machine. Termination of an instance means that you can no longer access the machine. As soon as the status of an instance changes to **shutting down** or **terminated,** you stop incurring charges for that instance.

### Difference between stop and stop-hibernate

When you stop an instance, it enters the stopping state until it reaches the stopped state. AWS does not charge usage or data transfer fees for your instance after you stop it. But storage for any Amazon EBS volumes is still charged. While your instance is in the stopped state, you can modify some attributes, like the instance type. When you stop your instance, the data from the instance memory (RAM) is lost.

When you stop-hibernate an instance, Amazon EC2 signals the operating system to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk), which saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to the EBS root volume. You can hibernate an instance only if hibernation is turned on and the instance meets the hibernation prerequisites.
