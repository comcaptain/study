Good morning/afternoon/evening to everyone in different time zone,

My name is Sun Guoqiang (you can also call me Tony). I am honored to be here today to share my journey from Associate to VP. Let me take you through my background, career growth, and current role.

I graduated in 2012 and have spent the past decade working as a full stack developer. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on both front-end and back-end development. On the back-end, I have primarily worked with Java, while on the front-end, I have progressed from using jQuery + IE6 to React and TypeScript with Chromium.

In June 2022, I joined JP Morgan. Initially, I was assigned a small front-end project. I am proud to say that the project was a success and set the stage for my subsequent achievements here. At that time, our team was exploring new front-end development frameworks and technologies. I saw an opportunity to expand my initial project into a comprehensive front-end framework. This framework simplified the development of new applications, and soon, all new front-end applications in our team were being developed using this new framework.

One of the challenges we faced was the performance issues caused by an overload of trades on the UI. To address this, I implemented a new trade UI using AG Gridâ€™s viewport, which significantly improved performance. The new UI can easily handle over 1 million trades without any performance issue. This solution was so effective that it's gradually replacing the original trade UI.

My back-end development experience has significantly benefited my front-end work. While developing the new front-end framework, certain aspects required integration with the back-end. Having a strong understanding of back-end development allowed me to identify what was technically feasible and efficiently develop the necessary back-end components myself.

Additionally, I had the pleasure of mentoring an intern from India. This intern was a fast learner and, under my guidance, quickly became capable of independently developing projects and solving complex technical issues.

Currently, I am still deeply involved in development, focusing primarily on my role as a developer rather than a manager. My passion for coding drives me to continuously learn new things and work on personal projects during my spare time. For example, I learned React and TypeScript in my free time, which has significantly contributed to my professional growth.

In summary, my journey from Associate to VP has been driven by my dedication to continuous learning, my ability to identify and seize opportunities, and my commitment to mentoring and guiding others. I am grateful for the support and opportunities provided by this company, and I am excited to see what the future holds.

Thank you for your attention. I hope my story can inspire some of you on your path to VP and beyond. If you have any questions or would like to discuss anything further, please feel free to reach out to me.
