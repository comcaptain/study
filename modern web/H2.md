## Install

- There is a [windows installer](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
- The installer provides some convenient tools for you to access h2 DB

## Embedded File Mode

- The whole DB is stored in a single big file
- Embedded more does not allow more than one connection
- Its jdbc url contains file path
  - jdbc:h2:file:C:/pygmalion-data/h2/pygmalion
  - r2dbc:h2:file:///C:/pygmalion-data/h2/pygmalion
- Both of the urls above would store DB as file `C:/pygmalion-data/h2/pygmalion.*`

## [Create New User](https://www.h2database.com/html/commands.html#create_user)

Create an admin user:

```
create user tony password 'tony' admin
```

## Connecton to embedded file mode H2 DB

In server that uses embedded h2 DB, add code like below:

```java
final List<String> options = new ArrayList<>();
options.add("-tcp");
if (_allowOthers) options.add("-tcpAllowOthers");
options.add("-tcpPort");
options.add(String.valueOf(_port));
Log.info("Going to create H2 TCP server with options {}", String.join(" ", options));
Server.createTcpServer(options.toArray(new String[0])).start();
Log.info("H2 TCP server started. Now you can connect it with any H2 client. " +
         "URL is jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:{}/{}. Username/password are H2 DB username/password", _port, _dbLocation);

```
